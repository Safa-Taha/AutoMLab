## Installation and Usage

To run the app locally, you will need Python 3.x and the following dependencies:

- **Streamlit**: A framework for building machine learning and data science web apps.
- **Pandas**: A library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: A library for numerical computing.
- **Matplotlib**: A library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- **Seaborn**: A library for statistical data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: A library for machine learning in Python.
- **PyCaret**: A low-code machine learning library in Python.

You can install the required packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install streamlit pycaret pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
