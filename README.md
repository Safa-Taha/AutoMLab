## Overview
This application is a data analysis and visualisation tool that allows users to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualise data using various plots, and apply machine learning models using the PyCaret library. The application is designed to be user-friendly and offers a wide range of options for data preprocessing, visualization, and modeling.

## Features
- Data Loading: Users can upload a CSV file to load the dataset.
- Data Cleaning: The application allows users to fill missing values in numerical and categorical columns using various strategies such as mean, median, mode, or constant values.
- Data Encoding: Categorical columns can be one-hot encoded or label encoded.
- Data Visualization: Users can visualize data using various plot types, including histograms, scatter plots, box plots, heatmaps, and more.
- Modeling: The application supports both classification and regression tasks using PyCaret. Users can select the target column and specify the problem type.
- Model Evaluation: For classification tasks, users can plot a confusion matrix, and for regression tasks, users can plot feature importance.
